# mean

A basic MEAN stack app, for the lulz

## Development

### Requirements
* Node v10 (I recommend leveraging [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))
* MongoDB Community v4 ([Installation docs](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/))
* Angular v8 CLI (Installed via NPM: `npm install -g @angular/cli`)

### Setup
1. Clone down
1. In `./frontend/` run `npm install` and `npm start`
1. Get your local Mongo running with `mongod` (or your OS equivalent)
1. In `./backend/` run `npm install` and `npm start`
1. Visit `localhost:4200` in your favourite browser
